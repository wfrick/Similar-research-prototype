# Similar-research-prototype

These scripts were written to experiment with similarity metrics.

The idea was that the similarity of a new item -- a piece of research or a news story -- to existing headlines published by a publication already would let that publication find things to cover.

In this prototype, research RSS feeds are the input, and the research paper titles are compared to the publication's already published headlines.
